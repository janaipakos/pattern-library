# Reformation Pattern Library

A library of modules following BEM and using KSS as the style guide.

Because it primarily deals with naming and style, this library is easy
to enhance with React, Sass, or templates.

Each section has three main parts:

- example following provided flats
- markup showing html to copy into project
- reference to specfic line number in `styles.css`


## Install

You shouldn't need to build from scratch. Simply open `docs/index.html`. Otherwise:

```node
npm install
npm run build
```


## Usage

Open `index.html` located in the `docs` folder. It can be opened locally or served with `static-server` or `http-server`.
Make sure to serve from the `docs folder`.

```node
cd docs
static-server
```
